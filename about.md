I am a master student majoring in computer science at Purdue University.

### More Information

I love coding. I also love playing video games and watch people playing games. Currently my favourite games are Nintendo games Super Mario Odyssey and Legend of Zelda. I also love doing almost all kinds of exercises except walking on treadmills. My favourite band is Linkin Park. Their lyrics and music could touch my soul. I dreamed to go to their live concert one day but now it is too late to realize it. I am always in deep sorrow when I listened to their last album.
