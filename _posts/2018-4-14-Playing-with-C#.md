title: Playing with C#
---

I didn't have any experience with C# before. My favourite ones are Python, C, R, Java and so on. I used MacOS and Ubuntu instead of Windows. So this time, when I got a chance to play with them I thought this would be a wonderful opportunity to equip myself.

C# is a lot similar to Java so it is not that difficult to starting coding with this language. Building a C# project on Windows machine is much more convenient than do it on Linux machines.

Windows cmd line is a little different from the Linux style. `dir` is `ls`. `cd` is the same one as in Linux. And `\`  is used rather than `/`. The whole project in in `bigProject` and inside this directory, there is another directory `codes` and a file `codes.sln`. To open the project in Visual Studio, just open this file in VS and the project is imported. Using this IDE is simple. 

One more thing is that when I first compiled the project, I turned on `Debug` and running time was really big. Then as suggested by the Professor, I used `Release` instead of `Debug` so that the execution time is a lot faster while the results are the same.
