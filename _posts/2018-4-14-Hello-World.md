title: Hello world

My very first blog in this site. Not too much to say, just "Hello World"!

The blogs will be updated irregularly. I will post some methods of my ongoing projects so far.

Thank you for your attention!

<!--Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).-->

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.-->
